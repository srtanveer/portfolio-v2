              There's something strange happening in the world of academia and creativity right now.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every day, I notice talented researchers, writers, and creators quietly turning to AI tools—then going to great lengths to hide the evidence. It's almost as if they're committing a crime.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="content-block">
            <h2 className="h3">The Guilt Syndrome</h2>
            <p>
              This quiet anxiety has a name, at least in my mind: <strong>The Guilt Syndrome</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We treat our partnership with AI like an act of academic infidelity, a secret affair we're too embarrassed to admit. We use it in private but deny it in public. And honestly? That's absurd.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="content-block">
            <h2 className="h3">Tools of Every Era</h2>
            <figure className="content-image">
              <img 
                src="/assets/images/Blog Assets/Blog 1/BLOG 1 Creative Tools History.webp"

                loading="lazy"
                onError={(e) => {
                  e.target.src = '/assets/images/Blog Default.jpg';
                }}
              />
              <figcaption>Every era has embraced its tools—from quills to algorithms</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              Using a tool has never been a betrayal of creativity. It's part of it. Every era has its tools, and great minds have always embraced them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Did a Renaissance painter cheat by using a camera obscura to perfect perspective? Did the writer who swapped a quill for a typewriter betray literature? Of course not.
            </p>
            <blockquote className="blog-quote">
              To be ashamed of your tools is to be ashamed of the time you live in.
            </blockquote>

          <div className="content-block">
            <h2 className="h3">Romanticized Authorship</h2>
            <p>
              This guilt stems from a romanticized idea of authorship—the belief that authenticity only comes from doing everything manually. But real creativity isn't about typing every word with your own fingers; it's about having a vision. It's about shaping ideas, curating information, and expressing something meaningful.
            </p>
          </div>

              <figcaption>AI as your creative team—just like any other collaboration</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
              You're the director. AI is your cinematographer, your research assistant, your concept designer. In any other field, you'd thank your team in the credits. So why hide it in academia?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="content-block">
            <h2 className="h3">Holding Back Progress</h2>
            <p>
              This Guilt Syndrome doesn't just hold individuals back; it holds progress back. It prevents open conversations about how to ethically use and integrate AI. It keeps us pretending we're "pure," when in reality, we're all quietly relying on the same digital companions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="content-block">
            <h2 className="h3">Embracing the Process</h2>
            <p>
              Personally, I've decided to embrace it. I see AI not as a threat to creativity but as a collaborator. In my process, I proudly use every tool I can—from pencils to algorithms—and I make no apologies for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's stop hiding. Let's own our process. True innovation doesn't come from clinging to old methods but from fearlessly exploring new ones.
            </p>
