# Quick Image Generation Prompts for AI Tools

## For Midjourney

### 1. Hero Image
```
/imagine A split-screen composition showing contrast between guilt and confidence in AI use, left side: person hiding laptop screen in dark shadows looking anxious, right side: same person collaborating confidently with visible holographic AI interface in warm golden lighting, modern minimalist workspace, cinematic lighting, professional photography style, 16:9 aspect ratio --ar 16:9 --v 6 --style raw
```

### 2. Creative Tools History
```
/imagine Timeline evolution of creative tools from past to present, quill pen morphing into typewriter morphing into computer morphing into AI hologram, museum display aesthetic, warm nostalgic sepia tones transitioning to vibrant modern colors, educational illustration style, detailed and artistic --ar 16:10 --v 6
```

### 3. AI as Team Member
```
/imagine Film director's chair in spotlight labeled "Director", surrounded by smaller chairs in a semi-circle labeled "Research Assistant", "Editor", "Designer" with subtle AI circuit patterns, cinematic movie set atmosphere, dramatic lighting with warm amber tones, professional and inspiring mood --ar 16:10 --v 6 --style raw
```

### 4. Future Collaboration
```
/imagine Human hand and semi-transparent digital AI hand reaching toward each other in a handshake, particles and light rays connecting them, bright optimistic lighting with gold and white tones, transparent glass-like effects, futuristic but warm and inviting, professional digital art style --ar 16:10 --v 6
```

## For DALL-E 3

### 1. Hero Image
```
Create a split-screen image in 16:9 aspect ratio. Left side: A person at a desk hiding their laptop screen, looking guilty and anxious, surrounded by dark shadows and cold lighting. Right side: The same person in the same desk setup but looking confident and happy, with visible holographic AI interfaces floating around them, surrounded by warm golden lighting. Modern minimalist workspace. High-quality digital photography style.
```

### 2. Creative Tools History
```
Create an educational timeline illustration showing the evolution of creative tools. From left to right: an ornate quill pen and inkwell (sepia tones), a vintage typewriter (slightly more colorful), a 1990s computer (brighter colors), and a modern holographic AI interface (vibrant blues and purples). Museum display style with subtle spotlights. Each tool should smoothly transition to the next. Aspect ratio 16:10. Professional illustration style.
```

### 3. AI as Team Member
```
Create an image of a movie set with a director's chair in the center spotlight labeled "DIRECTOR" in gold text. Around it in a semi-circle are 4-5 smaller chairs each labeled with different roles like "Research Assistant", "Editor", "Concept Designer", with subtle circuit board patterns on them. Cinematic movie set atmosphere with dramatic amber lighting. Professional and inspiring mood. Aspect ratio 16:10.
```

### 4. Future Collaboration
```
Create an inspiring image of a human hand and a semi-transparent, holographic AI hand reaching toward each other for a handshake. Light particles, data streams, and glowing connections flow between them. Bright, optimistic atmosphere with warm golden and white lighting. The AI hand should look futuristic but friendly, made of light and glass-like transparency. Professional digital art style. Aspect ratio 16:10.
